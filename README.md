# PodCode

This will be the respository for the RUMDLoop Pod's codebase.

Please write all rough code in Python and then we will later migrate this to C/C++ to make it compatible with firmware.

### Directories

###### ComponentAndSystemTest

This will be code for the Component and System Test requirement of the pod.

###### DataOperations

This will be code to send data to the command from the pod and receive/decode data from the command.

###### SubSystemOperations

This will be code to operate the various subsystems of the pod.

###### SafetyOperations

This will be code to activate and manage safety mechanisms for the pod.

### NOTE: This organization structure is NOT final. Code will likely be merged later to make a coherent software system
